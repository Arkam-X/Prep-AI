# 🎙️ Talking AI Interviewer - PrepAI

The **Talking AI Interviewer** is a voice-based interview practice application where users interact with an AI interviewer through a real-time voice call. The system is designed to collect interview preferences conversationally and generate interview questions based on the user’s input.

The primary goal of this project is to explore **voice-first AI interaction** using modern web technologies and AI services.

3. The collected information is sent to a backend API.
4. The backend communicates with **Gemini** to generate interview questions.
5. Interview-related data is stored in **Firebase**.
